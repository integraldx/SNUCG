# SNUCG
This is repository for managing 2019s Computer Graphics Homeworks.  
This repository uses OpenGL, GLU, GLUT. And tested on Ubuntu 18.04, with X-window.  

## How to compile & Run
$ make run

## How to use
- Left click on sphere and drag to rotate camera
- Mouse scroll to zoom in and zoom out
- Ctrl + Mouse scroll to dolly in and dolly out
- 'R' to reset view to initial state
- 'X' to exit

## What I did
### HW#2
- Use of gluUnProject to calculate World Coordinate of clicked location
- Implementation of Quaternion system to calculate rotation
- Modifying FoV value to implement zoom
